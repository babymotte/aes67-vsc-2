# AES67 RS JACK Virtual Sound Card

ARJ-VSC is a virtual sound card for linux that uses the `aes67-rs` crate for sending and receiving audio streams and the JACK audio API (compatible with PipeWire) to route them to/from applications or hardware outputs on your machine.

It uses `aes67-rs-vsc-management-agent` and `aes67-rs-vsc-web-ui` to provide a web UI for configuring and managing input and output streams.
