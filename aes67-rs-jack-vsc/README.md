# AES67 RS JACK Virtual Sound Card

ARJ-VSC is a virtual sound card for linux that uses the `aes67-rs` crate for sending and receiving audio streams and the JACK audio API (compatible with PipeWire) to route them to/from applications or hardware outputs on your machine. It provides a web UI for configuring and managing input and output streams.
